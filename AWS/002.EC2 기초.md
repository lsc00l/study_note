# Amazon EC2

-   EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS offering
-   EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
-   It mainly consists in the capability of :
    -   Renting virtual machines(EC2) 서버 대여
    -   Storing data on virtual drives(EBS) 가상 드라이브에 데이터 저장
    -   Distributing load across machines(ELB) 일레스틱 로드 밸런서로 로드를 분산
    -   Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG) 서비스 확장 가능
    

## EC2 sizing & configuration options

-   Operating System(OS) : Linux, Windows or Mac OS
-   CPU - How much compute power & cores
-   RAM - How much rnadom-access memory
-   How much storage space :
    -   Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
    -   Hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
-   Network card : speed of the card, Public IP address
-   Firewall rules : security group
-   Bootstrap script(configuring at first launch) : EC2 User Data

⇒ 사용자가 원하는 대로 가상 머신을 선택하여 AWS에서 빌릴 수 있다.

## EC2 User Data

-   It is possible to bootstrap our instnces using an **EC2 User data** script.
    
-   `bootstrapping` means launching commands when a machine starts
    
    That script is only run once at the instance first start
    
    처음 실행 시 한번 만 실행된다. 부팅 작업을 자동화 하기 때문에 부트스트래핑!
    
-   EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as :
    
    -   Installing updates
    -   Installing software
    -   Downloading common files from the internet
    -   Anything you can think of
-   The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user
    
    모든 명령은 sudo로 한다
    

## EC2 instance Types - Overview

Amazon EC2 Instance Types 확인 가능 : [](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)[https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

모든 EC2를 인스턴스를 비교한 웹사이트 : [](https://instances.vantage.sh/)[https://instances.vantage.sh/](https://instances.vantage.sh/)

-   AWS has the following naming convention
    
    `m5.2xlarge`
    
    -   m : instnce class
        
    -   4 : generation
        
    -   xlarge : size within the instance class
        
        사이즈가 클수록 더많은 메모리 와 CPU를 가진다.
        

## EC2 instance Types - General purpose

-   Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
-   Balancee between :
    -   Compute
    -   Memory
    -   Networking

## EC2 instance Types - Compute purpose

-   Greate for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors :
    -   Batch processing workloads
    -   Media transcoding
    -   High performance web servers
    -   HIgh performance computing (HPC)
    -   Scientific modeling & machine learning
    -   Dedicated gaming servers

## EC2 instance Types - Memory purpose

대규모 데이터 셋을 처리할 때 빠른 성능을 제공

-   Fast performance for workloads that process large data set in memory
-   Use cases :
    -   High performance, relational/non-relational databases
    -   Distributed web scale cache stores 분산 웹스케일 캐시 저장소
    -   In-memory databases optimized for BI(business intelligence)
    -   Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructure data

## EC2 instance Types - Storage Optimized

-   Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
    
    로컬 스토리지 에서 대규모 데이터셋에 엑세스 할 때 적합
    
-   Use cases :
    
    -   High frequency online transaction processing(OLTP) systems
    -   Relational & NoSQL databases
    -   Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
    -   Data warehousing applications
    -   Distributed file systems

# Inroduction to Security Groups

-  Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
-  They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances

- Security groups only contain allow rules
- Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

# Security Groups Deeper Dive
- Security groups are acting as a "firewall" on EC2 instances
- They regulate : 
	- Access to Ports
	- Authorised IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
	- Control of inbound network(from other to the instance)
	- Control of outbound network(from the instance to other)

# Security Groups Good to know
- Can be attached to multiple instances
- Locked down to a region /VPC combination
- Does live "outside" the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't w see it
- It's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
	SSH 액세스를 위해 별도로 보안 그룹을 유지하는 것이 좋다
- If your application is not accessible(time out), then it's a security group issue
- If your application gives a "connection refufsed" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched
- All inbound traffic is bloked by default 기본적으로 모든 인바운드 트래픽은 차단
- All outbound traffic is authorised by default 아웃바운드 트래픽은 허용

# Classic Ports to know
- 22 = SSH(Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
- 21 = FTP(File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
- 22 = SFTP(secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP - access unsecured websties
- 443 = HTTPS - access secured websites
- 3389 = RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windowds instance
